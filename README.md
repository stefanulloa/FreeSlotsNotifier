# FreeSlotsNotifier
Distributed application integrating Bicing, Twitter and Telegram Services as part of a Development of Distributed Applications college project.

The main functionality of this application is notifying its users the amount of free slots at their preferred bike stations from the bicycle sharing system of Barcelona (Bicing). Users are notified via Telegram (using a bot we created for this purpose). 
The system publishes a REST API to accomplish the functionalities.
In addition, a Twitter account was set up so that it periodically publishes some statistics regarding Bicing (avg number of free bikes per station, percentatge of used bikes in the city, free slots near critical city points of interest) using its API.
